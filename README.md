##Step by Step implementation of Snowflake CI-CD (Continious Integration & Continious Deployment) as Github Actions & Infrastructure automation tool as Terraform 
#Step:-1
First let's walk through the terraform configuration files as follows .Snowflake configuration setup from scratch by Infratructure provisioning tool to reduce manual intervention 

Create main.tf


#Step2 :-

Create the Terraform main configuration file as "main.tf"

#Step3 :-

Create a seperate variables.tf file to provide all values which will call to main.tf 

#Step4 :-

Create a non-sensitive configuration file as "terraform.tfvars" to ensure the reusebaility across multiple environments by just applying the value of Snowflake account & region .

#Step5 :- 
We will kept all of the sensitive configuration information in Github secrets by the following steps :-

In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and create new secrets for SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME, SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD, SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT, and SNOWFLAKE_REGION.

#Step6 :-
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository. Inside this directory, create a YAML file for your GitHub Actions workflow such github/workflows/CI-CD.yml

This a pipeline configuration file which trigerrs CI & CD whenever any changes made into the respective DB & Schema .


#Step7 :-
Now, below is the Tree structure of this project
